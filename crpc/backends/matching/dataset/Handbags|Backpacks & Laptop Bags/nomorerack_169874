2-in-1 Lambskin Backpack and Purse_When you're out for the day and your bag starts to get a little heavy, you might find yourself wishing you'd brought a backpack instead. With the 2-in-1 Lambskin Backpack and Purse, switching over from a purse of a backpack is easy. This 2-in-1 bag serves as a regular purse, but when you want to switch to a backpack, all you have to do is unzip the strap to create double straps. The soft lambskin leather and patchwork stitching details give this bag a cool look that will look great no matter how you choose to wear it.
